// a is a identifier and 7 is a literal(constant value)
//Declaration of a variable.

// let 8harry = 7 //Not allowed it will throw an error
// let var = 7 // throws an error
//js is case sensitive

// var,const,let difference.
//var:used in ES6 , const:constant value in whole program , let: to declare block-scope variable.
//var can be changed from any place. let can be used to create a block scope variable
//In var updation and reclaration is allowed but in let you cant redeclare,only updation is possible.
